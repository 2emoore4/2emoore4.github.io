        <p>
          in the spring of 2014, my professor Ken Perlin co-taught a course at
          the MIT Media Lab called Shared Tangible Augmented Reality. the class
          focused on creating shared virtual spaces where participants could
          communicate and interact with each other.<br><br>
          for our final project, we were encouraged to explore person-to-person
          communication. our original idea was to create some kind of avatar
          that was passively controlled by human input like mobile device
          accelerometers, heart rate trackers, microphones, etc. however at some
          point we moved away from putting sensors on a body to putting sensors
          on a stationary device. this device ended up being a decorative
          fishbowl that people would keep in their home. this fishbowl would
          represent another person, and it would be a portal for communicating
          with that person.<br><br>
