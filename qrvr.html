          for virtual reality applications, developers must wield expensive
          equipment in order to do any head tracking. some people use mocap
          systems, which are basically infrared cameras. the big products like
          Oculus and Vive are using infrared lasers and sensors. these solutions
          are not only potentially expensive, but they also require external
          equipment.<br><br>
          before Valve partnered with HTC for the Vive, they used a headset with
          a camera mounted on it. the camera would point at codes that were
          printed and taped onto the wall. since the camera could see the
          positions of the codes, it could locate itself within the
           room.<br><br>
          I've started to build a web app that will track qr codes. when a phone
          is mounted into a cardboard headset, the user can sit in front of a
          computer screen, or a wall with paper codes, and the headset will be
          able to determine its own position based on the position of the codes.
          not only is this cheap and easy, but it also eliminates the need to
          send head positions over a network.<br><br>
          so far I've implemented the qr code tracker, which finds the code's
          three alignment tags. I'll still need to come up with a stereo 3d
          visualization to demonstrate the head tracking.<br><br>
