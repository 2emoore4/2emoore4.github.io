        <p>
          unfortunately I've got absolutely no demos or images of this project -
          I'll need to recreate it at some point. so please check out the github
          repo!<br><br>
          our lab got a dlp lightcrafter projector which can project
          1-bit-per-pixel images at 4000 frames per second. so we had the idea
          to use it for a high frame rate depth scanner. I used the projector to
          display line patterns, then a camera pointed at the patterns. the
          objects illuminated by the projector could be scanned by measuring the
          deformation in the line patterns. I based my patterns on the Gray code
          described in <a
           href="http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W2/477/2013/isprsarchives-XL-5-W2-477-2013.pdf">this
           paper</a>. this allowed us to acquire a full point cloud using only
          four frames. therefore using this projector, we could theoretically
          create a 1000 fps depth scanner. however the project fizzled out since
          we didn't possess such a fast camera.
