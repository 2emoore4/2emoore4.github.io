      <p>this is basically the same as my java wireframe renderer except in
      javascript. actually originally I wrote this in coffeescript (which is in
      the github repo) but I regret that and recently translated it to js. you
      can check this page's source for the js renderer.<br><br>
      I wanted it to look like hand-drawn sketches so I'm rendering
      at a low framerate and adding some noise to the vertices at every
      frame.<br><br>
      this is also capable of rendering in stereo and handling orientation
      changes for vr. I haven't tested this vr mode very much but you can try
      clicking this button to enable it. should probably work on a phone with
      a cardboard viewer but I don't know if the orientation changes are
      handled correctly.</p>
      <button onclick="initvr()">vr mode</button>
      <p>here's a video of a test 'sketch' I made a while ago. I put some
      crinkled paper in the background to enhance the hand-drawn effect.</p>

      <p>I also used this renderer for a programming-languages class project.
