          this page shows a semester-long project for a computer graphics course
          which was taught in java. for the first week, we made 2d animations.
          I created an interactive simulation containing squares and circles.
          the squares flee from the cursor and the circles create explosions
          which force away the squares.<br>

          this week we made our first 3d renderers. they only displayed
          wireframes but supported arbitrary geometries and could perform
          transformations.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          next our programs were able to create 'primitive' shapes like spheres
          and cubes. the meshes were generated procedurally.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          this demo shows geometry grouping. we were able to add many geometries
          to a single group so that they could all be transformed together. note
          all the cubes that are attached to the cylinder to form the saw blade.
          they are all being rotated together by a single transformation.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          during this week we finally started shading our geometries. this demo
          isn't particularly interesting because they are shaded completely
          black.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          the shading here is more complicated - the color is chosen based on
          the surface normals.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          finally we've got somewhat realistic-looking shading. this uses Phong
          shading and the Phong illumination model.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          this week we stopped working on our geometry renderers and moved to
          ray tracing instead. this only renders spheres but its lighting is
          much improved compared to the previous renderer.<br>
        </p>

        <iframe width="480" height="270"

        <p>
          this shows a bunch of improvements to the ray tracer from the previous
          week. some new techniques include subsampling and antialiasing to make
          the renderer faster and more precise around edges. this also shows
          moving lights and procedural textures.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          one cool thing about ray tracing is that shadows are really easy to
          render - this demo shows the same ray tracer with moving lights and
          shadows.<br>
        </p>
