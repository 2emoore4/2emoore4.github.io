        <p>
          this was the final project for a programming language design course at
          NYU's ITP program. throughout the course we studied and created our
          own programming languages.<br><br>
          for the final assignment we were encouraged to create a language
          designed for a very specific computing purpose. I created a lisp
          dialect that would be used to control an animation. I made a web
          app that contained my coffeescript 3d renderer, along with a timeline
          and a code editor. when you click on the timeline, the editor pops up
          and lets you type some lisp to control the actor in the
          animation.<br><br>
          here's a demo of the project.<br><br>
